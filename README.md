# lynch-bot
Multi-purpose discord bot

In constant development, designed for individual server use.

# Functions

# Google Image and Youtube Video Search
(search.py)
	Users can search for images and videos easily in their 	discord client. Must be set up with a Google Custom Search 	API prior to use. Utilizes themes.json to decorate 	commands for special occasions or for laughs.

# Event Coordination
(events.py, webserver.py)
	Users can create events that they would like others to 	participate in. They can either invoke discord bot 	commands to create events or use the bot's website.
	The bot will automatically advertise events to the 	server's set advertisement channel.

# Utility
(channelmaker.py)
	Users can create temporary voice channels for niche topics 	if they so desire. These rooms automatically clean up when 	left unoccupied. Voice channels that should be kept need 	to be marked as permanent.

# Fun
(halloween.py, spiritboard.py, judgementboy.py, wordoftheday.py)
	Users can celebrate Halloween by trick or treating, 	summoning a ghost through Ouija, or tracking days until 	Halloween. Users can cast judgement on eachother based on 	their answers to dangerous hypotheticals.

	Users can set a secret word, that when typed, alarms the 	whole server.

# Social
(voteoff.py, angrythoughtbees.py)
	Users can downvote eachother and jokingly put eachother in 	the corner of shame.
	Users can annoy their friends by making the bot spam them 	with custom made insults.

# Cross Server Communication
(JamesChat.py)
	Users can open a direct communication line between any servers Lynch-Bot resides in. At the moment, this is stylized to look like sci-fi styled "Star Control II" broadcasts.
